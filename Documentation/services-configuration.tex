\subsection{PostgreSQL Configuration}\label{subsec:postgresql-configuration}
\begin{flushleft}
    Currently, the database contains 2 databases.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item contact\_form
        \item shop
    \end{itemize}
    As a security feature, the login either by local or remote host, have enabled "SCRAM-SHA-256".
\end{flushleft}
\subsubsection[Contact database]{Contact database}
\begin{flushleft}
    As the name hints, this database is used to store the contact forms received using the contact page from the website.
    Yet, the database consists of one table.

    As the name hints, this database is used to store the contact forms received using the contact page from the website.
    Yet, the database consists of one table.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    It also contains a procedure called "insert\_form", which given the next information "\textit{(p\_name varchar,
    p\_email varchar, p\_text text)}", checks if the values are valid and in case of not being valid, will rise an error
    (more information in the Regex and Error List threads).
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    As a security measure, there been a user implemented using the next query:
    \lstinputlisting[language=SQL,label={lst:lstlisting}]{../Dockerfiles/postgresql/sources/contact_form_users.sql}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
    Taking a look at the query, we can observe that the first step is to revoke all the permissions in the database,
    that way we can ensure that all the users are limited to the options that we specifically gave.
